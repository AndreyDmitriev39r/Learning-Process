## Main priorities

* React.js - every day
  - finish egghead.io beginner course
  - w3s course using create-react-app
  - all remaining FCC certs from front end libraries, if stuck there - use existing local sandboxes to experiment
  - go through reactjs.org docs
  - as soon as front end cert acqured - build own react app(docs with ideas on desktop)


* DOM
  - nothing specific, but when working on react, see how same stuff is done in vanilla JS


* contrast ratio app - 4-5 times a week
  - remains main prior at least till first release

* CSS libraries
  - use bootstrap/sass/animate.css in fcc certs for front end libraries
  - optional: refactor some RWD cert project using SASS/bootsrap


* Job hunting/networking: 1-2 days a week invest couple of hours
  - start monitoring job vacancies on hh, maybe in more platforms
  - structure this data to get better understanding of popular reqiurements
  - start revising personal connections
  - search web for local communities, contact GDG

## Secondary priorities

* code challenges - at least once a week
  - finish all stuff where stuck:
    - insertion and quick sort
    - 2 euler problems
  - more priority to data structures, not to euler
  - remember: main goal not to solve, but learn when solving, so no over-investing effort here

* git, VS code, command line
  - create repo for messing with git functionality only purpose, call some folks from contrast-ratio to mess around with it together
  - all stuff you are doing with mouse - try to do with keyboard from time to time
  - learn more about debugging in VS code
  - recall VS code snippet stuff, start to use snippets, when you have an idea for them
